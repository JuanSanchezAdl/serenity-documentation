Sometimes it is required to retry a failed test. For the Junit tests, this can be achieved by setting the system property +test.retry.count+ to the maximum number of times you want the failed tests to be retried. All method tests will be executed until first successful run, but not more than +test.retry.count+ times.

For the Cucumber tests, there is an equivalent property +test.retry.count.cucumber+

Here is short example, for it we will use next test class:

[source,java]
----
include::{srcdir}/junit-retries/net/serenity/samples/retries/SampleTest.java[]
----

Steps class:

[source,java]
----
include::{srcdir}/junit-retries/net/serenity/samples/retries/TestSteps.java[]
----

If this test will be executed - it will fail:


[[retry_test_fail]]
.Report with failed scenario
image::retry_test_fail.png[]

If we set the property +test.retry.count=4+ in serenity.property file, the failing tests will be executed until they will be successful or the maximum number of tries will be reached:

The same test execution with the +test.retry.count+ property set will be successfull - because the method +then_example_result_should_be+ fails only twice, and third execution will be successful:

[[retry_test_fail]]
.Report with successful unstable scenario
image::retry_test_success_unstable.png[]

If you're using Jenkins for aggregating your test results use this folder pattern for JUnit test results:

----
target/site/serenity/SERENITY-JUNIT-*.xml
----

This will exclude the previous failed tests from your report.
